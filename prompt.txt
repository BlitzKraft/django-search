Your technicalinterview for the Senior Web Developer position at stackfolio
starts now!

You have 5 hours to code a solution to this prompt, host it somewhere, and send
us the link by 8pm EST!

Prompt:
Make a web app that starts as just a search bar (and maybe some web app
branding). When someone types in a query and submits it you should hit the Yelp
api and get some results. Take these results and display them in some
interesting way. You must show the actual businesses that are returned by the
query, but also show some additional information in some interesting way. One
example is to show summary statistics. Do not simply recreate Yelp. Yelp
provides a lot of interesting information and media (pictures/video). Be
creative!

Notes: This prompt is very vague and open ended by design. Think about it. You
   are the owner and designer of this product from front to back.

 * It doesn't have to be useful. It just has to be interesting.
 * You own the UI/UX. Don't email and ask specifics on the features or how
   the web app should operate.
 * The Yelp API can be found at:
   https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started
 * The Yelp API does require usage of OAuth. I understand that if you've
   never used it before, 4 hours isn't enough to understand OAuth. In this case,
   simply build a scraper for Yelp's main website.
 * However, there are lots of packages out there to deal with OAuth really
   easily.
 * Caching the results for faster load time gets bonus points. (What are
   points? Good question.)
 * You must deploy and host the solution somewhere. DO NOT deploy last
   minute. Leave some time for you to deploy! This is the downfall of many a
   developer.
 * Email back the link to the solution when you're done. Also zip up all
   of your code and send it as an attachment.
 * You may use an html template if you want. If you do, send us the raw
   template as well.
 * If you have any questions during the interviewemailpav@stackfolio.comor call
   Pav at 301-613-2697.
